// HOISTING
// To understand this, you need to understand how JS Execution Context works
/**
 * JS Execution Context
 * It consists of 2 parts - the creation phase and the exection phase
 * In Creation phase:
 *  - it creates a global or a window object 
 *  - it setups a memory heap to store variable and function references
 *  - it initializes those functions and variables with "undefined", for functions - it takes the whole function and stores
 * 
 * In Execttion Phase:
 *  - During this, the JS exectues the code line-by-line.
 *  - It assigns the variables and exectues the method/functions "line-by-line"
 *  - For every new function called, JS creates a new JS Exection Context altogether
 *  - JS also has a "call stack" - which is a mechanism to keep a track of all function calls
 *  
 * In Hoisting, JS moves the variable and function declartions to the top (during the creation phase)
 *
